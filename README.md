Code Organization:
Break down the code into smaller modules or packages for better organization and maintainability.
Separate the application logic into different files like routes, models, and helpers.

Error Handling:
Implement better error handling mechanisms, especially for database operations and form validations.
Use try-except blocks to catch and handle exceptions appropriately.

Security:
Implement CSRF protection for forms to prevent cross-site request forgery attacks.
Consider using HTTPS for secure communication, especially when dealing with sensitive user data.

Database Operations:
Use SQLAlchemy ORM consistently throughout the application for database operations to ensure consistency and readability.
Implement database migrations for managing database schema changes over time.

Email Notifications:
Uncomment and implement email sending functionality for user notifications and password resets.

Logging:
Implement logging for debugging and monitoring application events.
Configure different log levels for different environments (development, production).

User Experience:
Improve user interface design and user experience for better usability.
Add more informative messages and alerts for users during different operations.

Deployment:
Prepare the application for deployment to production servers.
Configure production-level settings for security, performance, and scalability.

Documentation:
Add comments and docstrings to explain complex logic and improve code readability.
Create a README file with instructions on how to set up and run the application.
